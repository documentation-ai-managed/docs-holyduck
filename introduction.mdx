## What is HolyDuck?

HolyDuck provides a centralized space for your project documentation. You can create, organize, and collaborate on docs with your team effortlessly. It supports version control, search, and easy sharing, making it ideal for technical teams, product managers, and developers.

Unlike traditional wikis, HolyDuck uses a modern MDX-based system that renders rich components like interactive tabs and code examples. Start by inviting team members and structuring your content with folders and pages.
